Why we used function ?
=> In our programing when we used a same code more time that time it reduce the redundency of our program . By using function we recall that think more time .. like this ......


def calSum (a,b,c):    // it is function

  sum=(a+b+c)     // this line is for logic
  print(sum)     // This line is for print the logic
  return sum    // this line is for return our function

calSum(2,4,3)     //Those line is responsible for calling our function  
calSum(6,7,4)



*** sep function = It make a gap autometically .





** it is also a type to write function

def cal_mul(a=2,b=2):
  multi = a*b
  print(multi)
  return multi

cal_mul(4,4)




*** OOP 
What is class ?
=> Class is a blueprint for creating an object .


*** If we do not write constractor that time python autometically create constractor foe us 


***  what is Static Method ?
=> It is type of Method that does not required any self parameter(Work at class level).


*** What is Abstraction ?
=> Abstraction means that Hinding .
Hinding the implimentation details of a class and showing the essential features to the users .

*** What is Encapsulation ?
=> Warping data and function into a single unit(object)

*** Privact in python 
 just use this __
